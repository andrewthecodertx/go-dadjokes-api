A simple and fun REST API service written in Go that serves and stores dad

collection.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewthecodertx/go-dadjokes-api.git
cd go-dadjokes-api
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
go mod init go-dadjokes-api
go get github.com/gorilla/mux
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
go get github.com/lib/pq
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your database configuration:

```env
DB_CONN_STRING="postgres://user:password@host:5432/database_name?sslmode=disable"
```

4. Set up the PostgreSQL database:

```sql
CREATE TABLE jokes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    entry_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    author VARCHAR(255),
    joke_text TEXT
);
```

## Running the Application

### Development

```bash
go run main.go
```

The server will start on port 3000.

### Production

1. Build the binary:

```bash
go build -o dadjokes-api
```

2. Configure Nginx using the provided configuration:

```nginx
server {
    ...

    location /api/v1/random {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/random;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }

    location /api/v1/submit {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/write;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_method POST;
        proxy_pass_request_headers on;
    }
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Get Random Joke

```http
GET /api/v1/random
```

Response:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "entry_date": "2024-01-06T12:00:00Z",
    "author": "John Doe",
    "joke_text": "Why don't eggs tell jokes? They'd crack up!"
}
```

### Submit New Joke

```http
POST /api/v1/submit
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "author": "Jane Doe",
    "joke_text": "Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
    "id": 2,
    "entry_date": "2024-01-06T12:01:00Z",
    "author": "Jane Doe",
    "joke_text": "Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs!"
}
```

## Security Considerations

- The API uses HTTPS encryption in production
- Nginx acts as a reverse proxy
- Database credentials are stored in environment variables
- Input validation should be implemented before production use
